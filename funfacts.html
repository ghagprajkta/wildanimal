FUN FACTS:<br><br>
<font size="5px">
1.Lions are the only cats that live in groups.<br><br>
2.A group, or pride, can be up to 30 lions, depending on how much food and water is available.<br><br>
3.Female lions are the main hunters. While they’re out looking for food, the males guard the pride’s territory and their young.<br><br>
4.A lion’s roar can be heard up to eight kilometres away.<br><br>
5.Lions scent mark their territory, using their wee, to create a border.<br><br>
6.Lions are the most sociable of all the big cats.<br><br>
 7.They live in groups called prides, which usually consist of related females and their offspring. <br><br>
8. The typical pride consists of ten to fifteen lions, with several adult females, their cubs and up to four males.<br><br>
9. Some lion prides can be as large as 40 members.<br><br>
10.Lions can go up to four days without drinking water, but if available, they will drink water every day.<br><br>
11. Lions do need to eat every day.<br><br>
 12.Adult female lions need to eat about 11 pounds of meat each day, while adult males eat 16 pounds or more every day.<br><br>
 13.While lions primarily prey on large herbivores such as zebra, wildebeest, and buffalo, they have been known to prey on smaller animals like mice, birds, hares, lizards, and tortoises.<br><br>
14.Lionesses are the primary hunters of the pride. <br><br>
15.They are smaller and more agile than males and they use teamwork to bring an animal down. After a successful hunt, all the lions in the pride share the meal. But there is a pecking order, with the adult males eating first, followed by the lionesses and finally the cubs
 16.The males protect both the pride and the pride’s territory (which can extend up to 100 square miles) from competing prides and other predators. Anywhere from 85-90% of the hunting is done by the females in a given pride.<br><br>
 
17. Fanning out, they form a semicircle, with the smaller lionesses herding the prey towards the center. A lion’s vision is roughly six times more sensitive to light than humans, giving them a distinct advantage when hunting at night. Lion’s claws are retractable, reaching up to 1 ½ inches in length, allowing for the tremendous control when it needs to go in for a kill. Lions can also reach speeds of up to 50 miles per hour in short bursts and can jump up to 36 feet.  So, it is easy to see why the lion is referred to as the “king of the jungle”, which leads us to our next
 Although lions are known as the "king of the jungle", lions in Africa do not actually live in a jungle. Instead, their primary habitats consist of Africa’s grasslands and plains. Three of the five largest lion populations are found in the wide-open savannas of Tanzania.
 Lions communicate in different ways using sounds like roars, growls, moans, and grunts. Also, by leaving scent markings and through visual signals, such as the darkness of the mane. They also rub their heads on one another as an act of bonding and to spread the "family scent". <br><br>
 18.A lion's roar can be heard up to 5 miles away. This is a warning to other predators and to protect their territory from competing males, also to attract mating partners.<br><br>
19.When they are born, cubs are very small, and their eyes are closed until they are two to three weeks old.  Even then, they cannot see properly for another few weeks. This is when they are vulnerable to attack from large birds, snakes and even male lions.
20. A lioness will keep her cubs hidden from other lions for around six weeks until they are old enough to follow the pride.  Lion cubs are full of life and grow up playing with the other youngsters in the pride.<br><br>
 21They can be seen leaping, rolling, and gently biting. <br><br>
 This type of play builds strength and family bonds.Only slightly smaller than the Siberian tiger, the lion is the second largest big cat, with a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. Unlike all other big cats that are solitary hunters, lions are social animals and live together in prides. <br><br>
22. Male lions can grow up to 10 feet in length and weigh up to 550 pounds, while female lions can grow to a length of 9 feet and weigh up to 390 pounds.Most lions spend all their time on the ground, but in some parks across Africa they have learned to climb trees. Compared to leopards, they are not very graceful at climbing trees as they are not adapted for climbing.<br><br>
23. Most prides of lions do not climb trees, and big males are less likely to climb a tree because they are so heavy. The reason why lions climb or sleep in trees is to get away from pesky biting flies and insects on the ground. It can be cooler up in a tree, and they have a higher vantage point to see if any other animals are nearby.<br><br>
24. Lions may also be forced to climb a tree temporarily to try to escape from an angered herd of buffaloes. These special tree-climbing lions are most popular in Tanzania and Uganda. Queen Elizabeth National Park, Lake Manyara National Park, Lake Nakuru National Park, and Tarangire National Park are the best places to possibly see them. With that said, some lucky visitors to the Serengeti have seen lions in trees too.Three-quarters of African lion populations are in decline. With only around 20,000 in the wild, they are officially considered vulnerable of extinction. Even though they are powerful and majestic, and have no natural predators, it is inconceivable that African lion numbers have fallen by over 40% in the last 30 years. The main threats to lions are loss of territory, lion/human conflict, and trophy hunting. As a traveler, you can do your part by traveling to national parks and game reserves that put resources toward protecting Africa's lions.<br><br>

25.Young lions have rosettes and spots on their sandy coats, but these generally disappear as they mature. 
On average, males weigh 190kg (almost 30 stone) and females weigh 126kg (almost 20 stone).  They need this weight and power behind them to hunt large prey and defend their pride. <br><br>
26.Lions are highly adaptable and can live in very dry areas like the Kalahari Desert. Here they get most of their water from their prey and will even drink from plants such as the Tsamma melon. <br><br>
27Lions can eat up to 40kg of meat in a single meal - around a quarter of their body weight.  Their tongues have sharp-pointed rasps, called papillae, which are used to scrape meat off the bones. <br><br>
28.Lions do most of their hunting at night as their eyes have adapted to the dark and this gives them a huge advantage over their prey.  They hunt more during storms as the noise and wind make it harder for prey to see and hear them.  
 role of 'wing' - the wings chase the prey towards the centres.<br><br> 
29.Lions are the only known cat species where individuals roar together - with even young cubs joining in with their mews. The calling sequence usually lasts about 40 seconds.  Prides often roar together to mark their territory - a roar can be heard from 5 miles away. <br><br>
30.There are thought to be as few as 23,000 lions left in the wild. When you think there are around 415,000 wild African elephants, you realise lion numbers are incredibly low.  In fact, lions have disappeared from over 90% of their historical range.
